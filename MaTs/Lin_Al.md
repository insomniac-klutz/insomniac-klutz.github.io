**A. Ranks**

  Scalers (Rank 0 Tensor) 

    A single numerical value. It doesn't have any dimensions or axes. 
    They are independent of any direction and have only magnitude
  
  Vector (Rank 1 Tensor) 
                  
    Representation of a point in space. 
    Is a one-dimensional array of numbers.
    Is often used to represent quantities that have magnitude and direction

  Matrix (Rank 2 Tensor)

    It is a two-dimensional array of numbers.
    Shape: (m, n) [where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns]
